1. Analog comparators are essentially one-bit analog to digital converters. 
Because it analyzes two analog input voltages and then produces a differential output voltage (digital) that indicates which of the two inputs is higher (high or low-level signal).
2. Overall, in terms of functionality, a comparator is similar to an operational amplifier, but comparators are designed to function with its output saturated at one power rail or the other and with positive feedback. 
3. In general, a comparator is most commonly in use in devices like analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that measure and digitize analog signals.
4. The output stage of analog comparators is wired to be more flexible than that of op-amps. Analog comparators often have a latch that permits strobing the input at the right time and a shutdown function that conserves power when the comparator is not needed.
5. Analog comparators can be configured to use a threshold detector to determine if an input voltage is greater than or less than a given reference voltage.
