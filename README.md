Analog comparators are essentially one-bit analog to digital converters. 
Because it analyzes two analog input voltages and then produces a differential output voltage (digital) that indicates which of the two inputs is higher (high or low-level signal).
Overall, in terms of functionality, a comparator is similar to an operational amplifier, but comparators are designed to function with its output saturated at one power rail or the other and with positive feedback. 
In general, a comparator is most commonly in use in devices like analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that measure and digitize analog signals.
